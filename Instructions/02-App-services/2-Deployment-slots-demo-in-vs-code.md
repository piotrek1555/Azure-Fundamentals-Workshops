# 02/2 - Deploy custom web app to App Services

In this walkthrough, you will extend previous exercise (02/2) where you have created and deployed custom web app, with deploying into deployment slots.

## Perquisite:
- Make sure, that you  have installed [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0). The SDK also includes the Runtime.
![net-core-sdk](/assets/net-core-sdk.PNG)
- The [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) from the VS Code Marketplace.
- The [Azure App Services extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice) from the VS Code Marketplace.

>**Note** You will need Visual Studio Code to follow alone this demo.

# Task 1: Add settings to your application

In this task, you will add some changes to the application. 

1. Open your solution, navigate to the `appsettings.json` file, and  change existing code with the following:

    ```json
    {
      "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
          "Default": "Information",
          "Microsoft": "Warning",
          "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
        }
      },
      "EnvName": "LocalDev",

      "Level1": {
        "Level2": "Dev setting"
      },

      "EnvironmentVariable": "Set in DEV",

      "ConnectionStrings": {
        "MyDBConnection":
            "Server=tcp:testdbnm.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=TESTING;Persist Security Info=False; User ID=uname;Password=pword; MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True; TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;"
      },

      "AllowedHosts": "*"
    }
    ```

2. Navigate to the `Index.cshtml.cs` file under the `Pages` directory, and replace the existing code with following:

    ```cs
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

    namespace CustomWebApplication.Pages
    {
        public class IndexModel : PageModel
        {
            private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

            public IndexModel(IConfiguration configuration)
            {
                _configuration = configuration;
            }

            public void OnGet()
            {
                ViewData["EnvName"] = _configuration["EnvName"];
                ViewData["Level2Setting"] = _configuration["Level1:Level2"];
                ViewData["EnvironmentVariable"] = _configuration   ["EnvironmentVariable"];
                ViewData["ConnectionString"] = _configuration.  GetConnectionString("MyDBConnection");
            }
        }
    }

    ```

3. Navigate to `Index.cshtml` file, and paste the following code at the end.

    ```html
    <div class="row">
    	<div class="col-md-12">
    		<h2>Application Settings</h2>
    		<ul>
    			<li><h3>Environment Name:</h3><h4>@ViewData["EnvName"]</h4></   li>
    			<li><h3>Level 2 Setting:</h3><h4>@ViewData["Level2Setting"]</   h4></li>
    			<li><h3>Environment specific variable Setting:</    h3><h4>@ViewData["EnvironmentVariable"]</h4></li>
    		</ul>
    	</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
    	<div class="col-md-12">
    		<h2>Connection Strings</h2>
    		<ul>
    			<li><h3>Connection String:</h3><h4>@ViewData["ConnectionString"]</h4></li>
    		</ul>
    	</div>
    </div>

    ```
4. **Save** your changes.

5. Run your app by entering `dotnet run` command in `Terminal` window, and see if it is working, you should see the settings from the `appsettings.json` file are displayed

   >**Note** the values are set to DEV

# Task 2: Configure production deployment slot

In this task you will configure settings for the production slot

1. Go to portal, and navigate to your **App Service** that you have created in the previous exercise.

2. On the **App Service** blade on the left pane in the **Settings** sections select **Configuration**, and add new application settings and Connection strings as follows:

    | Application Setting     | Value       | Comments                                                                   |
    | ----------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Name                    | EnvName     |                                                                            |
    | Value                   | Production  | We want this setting to be production specific value                       |
    | Deployment slot setting | **checked** | We want this setting to not be overridden by the staging slot when we swap |

    | Application Setting     | Value          | Comments                                                                           |
    | ----------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Name                    | Level1__Level2 | Nested settings needs to follow name convention, and we use 2x `_` for this reason |
    | Value                   | Prod setting   | We want this setting to be production specific value                               |

    | Name                    | EnvironmentVariable |                                                                       |
    | Value                   | Set in Prod         |                                                                       |
    | Deployment slot setting | **unchecked**       | We want this setting be overridden when we swap with the staging slot |
   
    Now let's add **Connection string** setting

    | Connection string Setting | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Comments                                              |

    | Value                     | Server=tcp:testdbnm.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=**STAGING**;Persist Security Info=False; User ID=uname;Password=pword; MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True; TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30; |                    Just change the value of `Initial Catalog` from `PRODUCTION` to `STAGING`                                   |


4. Check the settings and **Save**


   ![app-service-deployment-slots-configuration-staging](/assets/app-service-deployment-slots-configuration-staging.PNG)
   

# Task 3: Deploy your app to the staging slot

In this task you will deploy your application to App Services

1. Sign in to Azure in VS Code
    - If you already use the Azure service extensions, you should already be logged in and can skip this step.

    - Once you've installed an extension in Visual Studio Code, you need to sign into your Azure account.
    - In Visual Studio Code, select the Azure explorer icon, then select Sign in to Azure, and follow the prompts.

    ![azure-sign-in.png](/assets/azure-sign-in.png)

2. After signing in, verify that the email address of your Azure account appears in the Status Bar and your subscription(s) appears in the Azure explorer

    ![azure-sign-in-verify](/assets/azure-sign-in-verify.PNG)

3. Expand your subscription account and find your **Azure App Services** that you have created in the previous tasks and go further in the tree, by expanding Deployment slots until you get to the `staging` slot, right click and select `Deploy to Slot`

    ![vs-code-deploy-to-slot](/assets/vs-code-deploy-to-slot.PNG)

4. Select your application in the prompt at the top of VS Code

    ![deploy-to-slot-browse-app](/assets/deploy-to-slot-browse-app.PNG)
    
5. Click on **Add config** in the next prompt

    ![add-config-prompt](/assets/add-config-prompt.PNG)
    
- and then **Deploy**

    ![deploy-to-slot-deploy](/assets/deploy-to-slot-deploy.PNG)

1. On the right-bottom side, the notification prompt should appear, Browse your site 

    ![notification-prompt](/assets/notification-prompt.PNG)
   
- you should see that your local settings were overridden with `staging` settings, that you have configured in Azure Portal.

    ![publish-to-azure-staging-slot-result](/assets/publish-to-azure-staging-slot-result.PNG)


# Task 3: Swap slots

In this task you will swap slots between the `staging` and the `production` slot.

1. Navigate to your `App Service` **Production** **slot** that you created earlier.
2. Open up your production slot website in new browser tab it should display the previous version of the app
3. Switch back to the `App Service` and navigate to the **Deployment slots**
4. Click on **Swap** and wait until the swapping finish the process.

    ![app-service-deployment-slots-swap.PNG](/assets/app-service-deployment-slots-swap.PNG)

5. Switch back to your browser tab with application, and refresh the page. It should be similar to this: 
   
   ![app-service-deployment-slots-swap-result.PNG](/assets/app-service-deployment-slots-swap-result.PNG)
   
    >**Note** The EnvironmentVariable didn't change, that means, if you don't check the deployment slot setting in the Configuration settings, then the variable will be overridden only once, during the deployment, so it get the value from the deployment slot configuration, and if you swap slots, then it won't change. 


**Congratulations!** You know how to create and manage deployment slots in App Service!

>**Note**: To avoid additional costs, you can remove this resource group. Search for resource groups, click your resource group, and then click **Delete resource group**. Verify the name of the resource group and then click **Delete**. Monitor the **Notifications** to see how the delete is proceeding.
