# Task 4: Deploy Custom .net application to App Services

In this task you will deploy your application to App Services from Azure Portal with `KUDU tools`

1. Navigate to your App Service that you created earlier in `Task 1` in this exercise.

2. Scroll down to `Development Tools` section, click on `Advanced Tools` and then click on `Go ->` link


   ![advanced-tools](/assets/advanced-tools.PNG)
